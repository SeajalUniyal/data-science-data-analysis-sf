# Delhi Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis

## Overview
This project is part of my **ShadowFox Data Science Internship (Intermediate Task)**.  
The goal is to analyze Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) using pollutant data and derive insights that support air quality improvement and public health strategies.

## Objectives
- Compile and clean air quality data.
- Compute a simplified AQI using key pollutants.
- Visualize AQI trends and pollutant relationships.
- Assess AQI levels against standard benchmarks.
- Summarize insights and suggest improvements.

## Dataset
- **File:** `delhiaqi.csv`  
- **Pollutants included:** PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO, NH₃  
- **Period:** January data sample (for demonstration)

## Results
- AQI values consistently exceed WHO safe limits.
- PM2.5 and PM10 are the primary contributors to poor air quality.
- January data indicates “Poor” air quality, highlighting the need for stricter emission control measures.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
